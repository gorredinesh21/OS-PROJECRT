  DESCRIPTION:
  Introduction:

This project involves the creation of a simple TCP client-server program for file handling. The server creates a TCP socket and binds it to a port number and IP address. It listens to incoming connections from clients and accepts them. Upon connection, the server receives a URL from the client and writes it to a file named "GET.txt". The server then sends a confirmation message to the client.

The client creates a TCP socket and connects to the server using the server's IP address and port number. The client prompts the user to enter a URL, which is then sent to the server. The client waits for a confirmation message from the server and then terminates the connection.
